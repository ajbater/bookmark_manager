# Bookmark Manager
-----
```
As a user
So that I can easily visit my favourite websites
I'd like to see a list of links on my homepage
```

```
As a user
So that I can quickly find my recently bookmarked sites
I'd like to see links in descending chronological order
```

```
As a user
So that I can save a website
I'd like to be able to add site address and title to the bookmark manager
```

```
As a user
So that I can organise my links into categories
I'd like to be able to add tags to the links in my bookmark manager
```

```
As a user
So that I can save time
I'd like to be able to filter my links by tag
```
